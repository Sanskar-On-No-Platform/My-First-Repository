# My-First-Repository!!!

Hello, Guys! This is my first GitHub Repository page, so if anything feels wrong to ya, just contact me!

## What are we even doing here?  
Well, this is just me messing around, so yeah — basically anything, especially related to **Python, Lua, a bit of Node.js, etc.**  

Please **don't put random nonsense** in here.  
>> **This repo is NOT about messing around...**  

### Rules & Guidelines:  
- **Stay optimistic.** If you're stuck, reach out to others!  
- **Upload HTML too!** I love that stuff.  
- **Suggest files** if you have ideas. Check my availability at the bottom.

Lmfao, I got too formal there.  

Just remember:  
> **Love each other and contribute towards humanity's growth.**  

Lol, that got too serious.

# **Python**  
### Python is an easy language:  
- **English-like syntax**  
- Easy to learn, but hard to master (trust me, it's worth it)  

### Best Practices:  
- **Use type annotations** (like `num1: int = 10`)  
- **Write reusable functions** and structure your code clearly  
- **Always specify return types** (`def ret_num(*args) -> int:`)  

Please **don’t edit this Markdown** unless you have *really* good suggestions.

### **Availability:**  
I’m usually online from **2100 hrs to 2200 hrs (IST)**, but sometimes I might be unavailable.
