Lol, that was too serious

# Python
### Python, is an easy language
- English - like Syntax
- Easy to learn, but hard to master (but trust me, it will be fruitful)
  And yes, it is ***Really*** good to :-
  - Use type annotations (like -> num1: int = 10)
  - Define your functions, clear and crisp, and focus towards re-usabilty, even with classes
  - Always specify the return methon (like --> def ret_num(*args) -> int: )

Please try not to edit this Markdown, except when you have *really* good suggestions.

Try to conatct me, I am available from 2100 hrs to 2200 hrs (IST)
